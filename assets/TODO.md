reusable make file includes, with standardised variables names

## TODO

GIT
- Need tagging added. We have the ability to clone by tag already.

VSCODE 
- Need ability to debug without any settings in the project, and having to open it.
- flags dont seem to work
- DOCKER: Ops has a helper for debugging a docker with golang project inside. We should formalise this into vscode, since it relies on vscode and docker.

GCLOUD
- Need ability to easily deploy to CloudRun, and map to Domain
- Versioning is also important so that the name of something on gcloud shows what git SHA ( and / or git tag)

GO
- obfuscation using gable
